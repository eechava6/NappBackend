Input Matrix A
Input Vector b


if Matrix A is not square then
	Output "Not square matrix"

if determinant is equal 0 then
	Output "Determinant is 0"

matrix U = initialize Identity
matriz L = initialize Identity

if diagonal of matrix A have 0 then
	Output "0 in diagonal"

while column is minor than size of matrix
	
	get multipliers of column
	
	matrix A = A apply row operations

	column of matrix L = L add multipliers obtained

matrix U = matrix A

matrix Lb  = concatenate matrix L with vector b
vector z = progressive sustitution matrix Lb

matriz Uz = concatenate matrix U with vector z
result = regresive sustitution matrix Uz

Output results
