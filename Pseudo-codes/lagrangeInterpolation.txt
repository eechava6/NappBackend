input vector X
input vector Y

while index of vector x < size of vector X then
    while index of vector x 2 < nx then
        if index of vector x not equal index of vector x 2
            lagrange polynom = vector Y * (x - index of vector x)
            lagrange polynom = lagrange polynom * 1 / (index of vector x 2 - index of vector x)

Output the lagrange polynom is
    lagrange polynom
